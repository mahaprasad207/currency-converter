# Currency Converter

## **Description**

The **Currency Converter** is a simple yet functional web-based application that allows users to convert an amount of money from one currency to another in real-time. This tool uses the current exchange rates provided by the **ER-API** to ensure accurate and up-to-date conversions. The user can select a source currency and a target currency, input the amount to be converted, and instantly get the result based on the latest exchange rate.

### **Key Features:**
- **Real-Time Currency Conversion**: Converts any entered amount between two currencies based on live exchange rates.
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can select the "from" and "to" currencies via dropdown menus and see the corresponding flags of each currency.
- **Visual Elements**: Flags are dynamically updated for the selected currencies, enhancing user interaction.
- **Simple and Clean Design**: The interface is minimalistic yet user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to use without confusion.
- **Cross-Currency Support**: It supports numerous world currencies, such as USD, INR, EUR, GBP, and many more.

### **How It Works:**
1. **User Input**: The user enters an amount they want to convert and selects the source currency (e.g., USD) and the target currency (e.g., INR).
2. **Fetching Data**: Upon clicking the "Get Exchange Rate" button, the application sends a request to the ER-API to fetch the latest exchange rate data.
3. **Currency Conversion**: The app calculates the conversion using the fetched exchange rate and displays the result immediately.
4. **Dynamic Display**: The displayed exchange rate is updated with each new currency selection, showing both the rate and the converted amount.

### **Technologies Used**:
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and making the user interface visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the main functionality, including data fetching, currency selection, and display updates.
- **ER-API**: An API that supplies real-time exchange rates for different currencies around the world.

### **Example of How it Looks and Works**:
- The user enters `100` in the input field.
- Selects **USD** (United States Dollar) as the "from" currency.
- Selects **INR** (Indian Rupee) as the "to" currency.
- The app fetches the current exchange rate (e.g., 1 USD = 80 INR).
- The result will be displayed as `100 USD = 8000 INR`.
